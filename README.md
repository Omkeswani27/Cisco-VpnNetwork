# VPN in Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository demonstrates the design and implementation of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project showcases how to securely connect two or more remote networks over the internet, providing data confidentiality and integrity.

## Introduction

VPN (Virtual Private Network) ensures secure and encrypted data transmission over the internet.
- Allows secure remote access for employees, ensuring business continuity.
- Facilitates seamless interconnection between branch offices and data centers.
- Supports secure use of public Wi-Fi networks.
- Encrypts communication to protect data from unauthorized access.

## Objectives of the Project

- To implement a secure VPN (Virtual Private Network) using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- To establish encrypted communication between two or more networks.
- To ensure secure data transfer over public networks.
- To validate the connectivity and reliability of the VPN tunnel.

## Features

- Secure communication between branch offices
- Configuration of IPsec VPN
- Implementation of network encryption and decryption
- Secure data transmission over public networks
- Practical example of site-to-site VPN setup

## Tools & Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Network simulation software used to design and configure the VPN.
- **Cisco Routers and Switches**: Virtual devices within Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of networking concepts (IP addressing, subnetting, routing)
- Familiarity with Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system (version 7.0 or above recommended)

## Usage

1. Open the provided Packet Tracer file.
2. Review the network topology and device configurations.
3. Simulate network operations and test connectivity.
4. Modify or extend the design as per requirements.
